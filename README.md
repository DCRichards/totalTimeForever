# Two Ticks Twice

__Two Ticks Twice__ is a simple [Pebble](http://getpebble.com/) watchface which provides a simple display for essential watch information (time, date, battery and bluetooth connection).

### What's with the name?

It pays homage to the unstoppable musical force that is [Foals](https://play.spotify.com/track/6VyAdiXrCAhbX3PoQzcVPL?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open), who take the credit for being the soundtrack to this moonlight coding endeavour.
